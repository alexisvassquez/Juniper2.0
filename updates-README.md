# ‚ú≥Ô∏è Project Updates - README.md


## ‚öôÔ∏è Updates:

### 2024-09-30
Model Base Change:
- Switched from **GPT-2** to **DistilGPT-2** due to resource limitations on **ChromeOS** (Crostini)

Step 1 Completion: ‚úÖ
- Successful installation of key packages:
  - **PyTorch**
  - **Hugging Face Transformers**
  - **OpenAI DistilGPT-2 datasets**

Jump to Step 3 (Fine-Tuning): üí¨
- Fine-tuned DistilGPT-2 using the **OpenWebText** dataset.

System Improvements:
- Added extra storage, routed microSD card to Linux environment to resolve temp storage issues.
- Addressed storage limitations that initially prevented testing fine-tuned model.

Repository Updates:
- Began editing Juniper2.0 repository.


## üìå Next Steps:

### 2024-09-30
Collect Additional Datasets: üí¨
- Explore more datasets for model fine-tuning.
  
Model Integration:
- Build either CLI or UI for user interaction
  - Options incl **Flask** or **Django**.
    
Model Refinement:
- Cont improving fine-tuned model's performance.
  
Custom Dataset Creation:
- Develop custom samples from Juniper (GPT-4) dataset.
  
Further Testing:
- Begin testing more input/output scenarios with the fine-tuned model.
  
System Optimization:
- Apply additional sys optimizations to improve efficiency as necessary.
